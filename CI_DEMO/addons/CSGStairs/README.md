# CSGStairs
Addon for creating procedural stairs in Godot Engine

I made this to test my stair climbing mechanic for my character controller. Not intended for use in actual games.

Shift + left click and drag on points to control the curvature.

	stringer_material, riser_material, thread_material

Materials for the side/base, front and top of steps. Using a triplanar material is recommended (especially for the stringer). Stringer material will be used if the other materials are not assigned.

	use_collision, collision_layer, collision_mask

Collision settings for the CSG node.
