# Why //CONST //INT
Godot leverages Entity-Component Patterns, Flyweight Patterns and Observer Patterns masterfully. This probably makes NO sense if you are not a programmer, which is why YOU are the type of person I am making this for. 

//CONST //INT is aimed to act as your technical artist and systems engineer, allowing you to just hop in and make 3D games. 

If you are a programmer, //CONST //INT aims to fill in the gaps of systems you don't want to keep writing time and time again; allowing you to just make the tings that are fun for you.

//CONST //INT is inspired greatly by the way Valve and Source engine games feel, and a huge aspect of that is strong toolset that they've unleashed onto their audience allowing them to make amazing games and experiences. 
That is what I aim for this project to be for Godot.

# How can I help //CONST //INT
Look [Projects](https://github.com/users/ionthedev/projects/2) page and pick and issue a task that isn't already an active issue. Once you feel it's ready, make it a PR and it will go through the process. The project should follow the [Contributing Guidelines set by Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/ways_to_contribute.html) as close as possible and the project will be built upon to further reflect those guidelines for a solid foundation of mutual understanding.
